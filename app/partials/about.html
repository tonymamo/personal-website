		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h2 class="page__subheading">Professional Summary</h2>
		<p>Now with over eight years of professional experience, I am currently managing a team of developers as a Technical Lead at Optum Technology, part of UnitedHealth Group. Having started off my career freelancing after being self-taught in design and development principals, I have worked with new startups and small businesses, established mid-sized companies, as well as large corporations in various industries. Non-technical expertise includes leadership, interviewing, Agile/Scrum methodology, resource allocation, project estimation, and timely deliveries of product.</p>

			<p class="small">Tony is not only our resident guru, he has set the bar high for all of UHG with the cutting edge client-side design and coding.  I’ve reviewed many of his most innovative implementations, and he never ceases to amaze me with his creativity and attentiveness to usability and lean, scalable coding practice, most of which I’d put up against leaders in the industry at large.</p>

		<h2 class="page__subheading">Skills &amp; Competencies</h2>
		<p>Funny story: I got my start in the web industry trying to make my band's Myspace page cool.</p>
		<p>I've always had a keen eye for design and aesthetics, and once I taught myself Illustrator and Photoshop, then next progression was figuring out how to get it on to the web. After breaking down the pieces, I had my "ah-ha" moment, in which I had realized that I just learned the fundamentals of web development.</p>
		<p>Fast forward almost a decade&mdash;the web has made a lot of progress. I, too, have come a long way in those years. Here's a few things I know a thing or two about:</p> 
		<ul class="columns">
			<li><span class="icon icon-html5"></span> HTML5</li>
			<li><span class="icon icon-css3"></span> CSS3</li>
			<li>Javascript (jQuery &amp; AngularJS)</li>
			<li>Adobe Experience Manager (aka CQ5)</li>
			<li>Responsive Web Design</li>
			<li>Version Control (Git &amp; SVN)</li>
			<li>Accessibility</li>
			<li>Object Oriented CSS Abstractions/Patterns</li>
			<li>Semantic Markup</li>

		<h2 class="page__subheading">Personal Life</h2>
		<p>Outside of work, I spend my life with my lovely wife Mallorie and our fluffy white dog, Zoe. We are big foodies, coffee snobs, and enjoy finding new craft beers and cocktails. We also love to travel and be outdoors, exploring different cultures, cities, and landscapes. When we aren't hiking or backpacking, we might be exploring Metro Detroit on our motorcycle, or spending time with our families and friends.</p>
