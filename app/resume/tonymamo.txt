KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Major Refactor
Took large, enterprise-sized website and conducted a major refactor in spare time over the course of two weeks. Went from seven templates down to three, and reduced CSS files from over 8,000 lines to just 3,000. Broke up CSS in to LESS partials for easier maintenance, and refactored out any specificity issues, eliminating all !importants and overly specified selectors.

Built Framework
Along with one other developer, built out the entire framework that the entire development team would later use on every project. Wrote documentation about syntax, formatting, naming conventions, and other best practices for better collaboration across all developers. Built pattern library to visually illustrate the framework elements, along with code samples and suggested uses. Included more advanced-level techniques, incorporating BEM naming and OOCSS abstractions.

Project Expert
Worked on enterprise site for almost three years, starting with a proof of concept and demos to pitch to potential clients, and eventually building out the templates and components that would later be used by over 20 different teams. Only developer to continuously be involved with the project from initial conception to production, ultimately serving as a project lead on three different workstreams (simultaneously) all working on a part of the greater project.
